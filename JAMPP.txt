Question 2 ) 


The query given :


WITH events AS (
    SELECT
        device_id , 
        time_stamp ,
        LEAD(time_stamp) OVER (PARTITION BY device_id ORDER BY time_stamp) as next_time_stamp
    FROM events_table
    WHERE month='201908'
    AND app_id = 1
    AND event_id = 4
), 
per_event AS (
    SELECT
        device_id , 
        DATE_DIFF('second' , time_stamp , next_time_stamp ) as time_diff
    FROM events
), 
    SELECT 
        device_id ,
        AVG(time_diff) as avg_per_user
    FROM per_event
    GROUP BY 1


The events table statement first create a new column which is the next timestamp for some action “4” , so we can substract
then the next timestamp from the current one (this query is made by device_id and order by time_stamp so as to be sure that is just the next near value ). Once made the substraction between timestamp wecalculate the average time difference between when user made action 4 against hisnext time he performs action.


This metrics is relevant for the business side because provides you information about the performance of the app. In the case
that the action is “purchase” , the metrics gives you a sense of how fast the user place money in your app again ( in some way
you are monitoring the engagement , the stickiness).


The query without a WITH function would be :


SELECT  
    device_id ,
    AVG(time_diff)
FROM (
    SELECT
        device_id ,
        DATE_DIFF('second' , time_stamp , next_time_stamp) as time_diff
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            device_id ,
            time_stamp ,
            LEAD(time_stamp) OVER (PARTITION BY device_id ORDER BY time_stamp) as next_time_stamp
        FROM events_table
            WHERE month='2019080
            AND app_id = 1
            AND event_id = 4
    )
)
GROUP BY 1


Question 3 )


The amount of pirates to send for look for the treasure can be represented by the following function : f(# monedas encontradas) = round((# monedas encontradas / 2 ) + 1). In words means that the ideal scenario for the captain of pirates is always to send the amount of pirates which represent the half of coins founded plus one. In this scenario, all the pirates send to find the treasure will receive only one coin and all the other coins left will be for the captain of the pirates, so he will received the half of coins find minus one. 


Aclaration: In the case that the amount of coins are odd the numbers of pirates it would be round up
